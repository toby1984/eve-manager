BUGS:

-> Remove IUserAccountStoreListener#aboutToBeXXX() methods ??
   Nobody cares about those kind of things until it already happened

- FileUserAccountStore does not extend InMemoryUserAccountStore !!
 -> Listener notification is currently partially broken , newly added methods
    IUSerAccountStoreListener#accountRemoved() / #characterRemoved()
   are never called from this class

   Subclass InMemoryUserAccountStore (add proper subclassing hooks before) 
   and things should work automagically

- Reverse refining is always off by a small amount (rounding issue ??)
- Skill tree view clips level progress indicator on skills with short names/labels 
- Training time calculation ignores progress
as made on skill currently in training
- using the "add/remove selected rows to import" from the popup context menu
  in the "import market log" window doesn't update JTable properly 
  (change to 'import?' flag is not rendered) 
- Prices that were unobtainable from EVE-central are rendered as
  'user-provided' with value 0.0

TODO:

- Exclude unused / unnecessary jars (mysql connector, JTA , jaxb etc.) in assembly.xml
- Blueprint browser: Add warning that production cost is 
  only based on raw material prices and does not factor in
 
   - invention costs
   - copying costs
   - installation costs

- Make skill tree view highlight the currently trained skill
- Make sure all components use AbstractComponent#displayStatusMessage(String)
  before performing long running tasks
- Make sure all components use AbstractComponent#displayStatusMessage(String)
  to inform the user about any (potentially) long-running tasks.
- Market price UI is somewhat crude, fix resizing of text area

FEATURES:

- Skill tree should highlight and properly render the skill
  the selected character is currently training
- Add (automated?) price comparison by region
- Add finance reporting / cash-flow charts

OTHER:

- remove excessive logging when storing / updating PriceInfo , especially from tight loops
